This program orbits a point and also rotates around the y-axis. Coding this was easy since it was only one line of code to do the rotate.

For the shader loader i put the shaders into two different files and created a shader loader that loads them into the correct vs and fs.

Only problem was loading the shaders on your computer since i didn't null-terminate my strings.
