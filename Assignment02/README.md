The program spins, stops and has menus with keyboard and mouse support.

Right click and click toggle rotate to turn the rotation on or off. LMB and 'a' spins the cube backwards.

No issues pretty straight-forward. I tried to make it stop spinning in teh same spot. I think it works but it appears wrong sometimes, I 
assumed it was just the buffer being weird sometimes. When you change the direction it always reverses from the correct position.
