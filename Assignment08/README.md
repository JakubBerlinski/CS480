Assignment08 -- Bullet
======================
Cameron Rowe is my partner for this project.

Arbitrary objects are able to be loaded and a physics mesh will be created to match that object.

### Compilation Notes ###
libfreeimage-dev, libbullet-dev, and libassimp-dev are required to compile this project.

### Problems ###
Could not create table with walls. A weird invisible wall appeared on top of the object.

## Interaction Options ##
Keyboard Options:

* W,A,S,D -- Moves the sphere acordingly.
* space -- Causes the sphere to "jump".
